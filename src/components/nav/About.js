      <p> As of February 2021,  Tesla bought bitcoin worth 1.5 billion $ and immediately started accepting payment in bitcoin as it's first crypto currency. but the world was in doubts because Elon Musk the CEO of Tesla in a tweet said Dogecoin will be the future of Cryptocurrency and he encouraged major dogecoin holders. </p>
      <p> After vouching for Bitcoin, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has now said that if major Dogecoin cryptocurrency holders sell their coins, he will give them his full support. </p>
      <p> He has been talking a lot about Dogecoin recently and it has come to our understanding that Dogecoin has a future in Tesla. </p>
      <p> Some of his followers believe Dogecoin will be the Official crypto currency in Mars </p>
      <p> Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency invented by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who decided to create a payment system. Nearly 113 billion coins have already been mined. </p>
      <p> "If major Dogecoin holders sell most of their coins, it will get my full support. Too much concentration is the only real issue imo (in my opinion)," Musk said in a tweet. </p>

      <p> Orbits is an organisation owned by a group of Crypto Miners and Investors to help recycle and reuse mined cryptocurrency in a way that is more efficient to the environment. Also to help investors cycle through their options. </p>  
      <p> The SpaceX reusable launch system development program is a privately funded program to develop a set of new technologies for an orbital launch system that may be reused many times in a manner similar to the reusability of aircraft. SpaceX has been developing the technologies over several years to facilitate full and rapid reusability of space launch vehicles. The project's long-term objectives include returning a launch vehicle first stage to the launch site in minutes and to return a second stage to the launch pad following orbital realignment with the launch site and atmospheric reentry in up to 24 hours. SpaceX's long term goal is that both stages of their orbital launch vehicle will be designed to allow reuse a few hours after return. </p>  
      <p> The program was publicly announced in 2011. SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015. The first re-flight of a landed first stage occurred in March 2017[2] with the second occurring in June 2017, that one only five months after the maiden flight of the booster.[3] The third attempt occurred in October 2017 with the SES-11/EchoStar-105 mission. Second flights of refurbished first stages then became routine, with individual boosters - namely B1049 and B1051- having powered up to eight missions as of January 2021. </p>
      <p> As of 2020, SpaceX is actively developing the Starship system, with the intent to make it a fully-reusable two-stage launch vehicle, intended to replace all of its existing launch vehicles and spacecraft used for satellite delivery and human transport—Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon—and also eventually support flights to the Moon and Mars. In addition it could be used for point-to-point transportation on Earth. </p>

      <h3> Environmental Benefits of Electric Cars </h3>
      <p> There are numerous benefits to the environment that come from using electric cars. The biggest is the decrease in carbon emissions. Cars can pollute the the air and release greenhouse gasses, which can impact global warming, and create smog. Electric vehicles, meanwhile, produce no emissions and do not impact the air in the same way</p>
      <p> Electric cars also decrease dependence on oil and gas. Drilling for these materials can often cause severe damage to waterways, animal habitats, and farmland. By reducing our need to access these resources, we can protect the environment and allow the full diversity of both plant and animal life to flourish. In addition, beautiful landscapes will be protected for generations of enjoyment. </p>

      <h3> How Consumers Benefit from Electric Cars </h3>
      <p> For consumers, electric cars can be a health and cost saving measure. While traditional cars release dirty air, which can cause breathing problems, electric cars have no emissions and can help improve the air quality in a community.</p>
      <p> Electric cars do not require gas, the price of which can fluctuate and increase dramatically throughout the year. Electricity, meanwhile, is cheaper and more stable in price. Electric cars can therefore save consumers money after they make the initial investment to purchase one. With more efficient technology leading to lower prices, electric cars are becoming more affordable than ever, helping more people purchase electric cars sooner.</p>
      <p> Electric cars are also very safe to drive. They undergo the same testing procedures as any other car and have the same safety features, such as airbags. In addition, the electric battery can shut off in the event of a crash. This helps prevent the car from continuing to move after impact, protecting drivers, passengers, and people outside the car. </p>
